# Sleep-till-Sunrise-Timer
Wake up with sunrise. Enter your sleep duration and location, this Python program should suggest the best time to sleep.

Hello world, I am a beginning programmer (if anyhow entitled) of Python.
The idea comes from the time I hesitate to sleep now or later at midnight for balanced sleep of effect and duration. I trained myself to wake up with the sunrise. Now I want to automate the process by get the time of sunrise. 
Also, to make it universal, I turn to Google GeoAPI and some website to convert users' location into sunrise time.
